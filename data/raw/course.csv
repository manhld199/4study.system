C_course-v1:TsinghuaX+60610231+2016_T2_SP,engineering ethics (autonomous mode),no prerequisites,"



the course engineering ethics has a wide range of social needs



firstlets start with the washington agreement 



in 1989 private engineering professional groups from six countries the united states the united kingdom canada ireland australia and new zealand initiated and signed the washington agreement for the mutual recognition of international undergraduate engineering qualifications engineering ethics education was included in the engineering professional education certification system in the system on june 2 2016 china became a formal member of the washington agreement an international mutual recognition agreement for undergraduate engineering degrees



lets talk about us registered engineers again 



beginning in 1996 the us registered engineer examination has included engineering ethics in the fundamentals of engineering exam a report from the national academy of engineering states that ethical standards are one of the basic qualities that future engineers must possess



the most important thing is to cultivate chinese engineers who are future oriented and world oriented 



chinas current one belt one road and made in china 2025 construction requires a large number of engineering talents with cross cultural and global perspectives it also requires engineers to have an awareness of engineering ethics in different cultures


in view of this engineering ethics education has received great attention from the engineering community education circles and relevant government departments it has become a consensus among all walks of life to comprehensively promote engineering ethics education in engineering education in 2015 the national engineering professional degree graduate education steering committee organized tsinghua university beijing institute of technology more than a dozen experts from universities peking union medical college dalian university of technology zhejiang university and other institutions collaborated to compile the engineering ethics textbook and record related mooc courses


this course is different from traditional engineering ethics theoretical education and highlights the practical nature of engineering ethics in specific engineering practice due to the complexity and uncertainty of engineering activities engineers also need to cultivate good engineering decision making capabilities not only to implement ethical awareness and ethical norms to solve ethical issues faced in engineering practice therefore the goal of engineering ethics education is not only to cultivate engineers engineering ethics awareness and sense of responsibility and guide them to master the basic norms of engineering ethics but also to improve engineers engineering ethics decision making ability through engineering ethics education therefore the course starts from engineering professional ethics and engineering ethics the course system is constructed from two aspects ethical issues in practice the courses are divided into general theory the mooc course is engineering professional ethics and sub theory the mooc course is engineering practice and ethical decision making  two parts the curriculum is based on facing chinese society facing chinas reality and facing chinas future

C_course-v1:TsinghuaX+10691113X+sp,classics of western thought and modern society (autonomous model),no prerequisites,"
if human history is roughly divided it can be divided into ancient society and modern society whether it is ancient society or modern society they are closely related to human thought real change in human society is guided by changes in thought and is shaped by the principles established by thought


what makes ancient society an ancient society is that it is based on five major principles established by ancient thought 1 the principle of teleology 2 the principle of goodness above all else 3 the principle of giving priority to responsibility and obedience 4 rule the principle that the legitimacy comes from a transcendent person outside of people fifth the principle that the collective takes precedence over the individual these principles are implemented and implemented by converting them into responsibility principles therefore ancient society first stipulated the relationship between people based on the principle of responsibility and used this to construct the order of the world


through the deep awareness and systematic demonstration of human individual freedom the enlightenment established a series of basic principles for modern society that are different from the principles of ancient society 1 the principle of freedom first 2 the principle of individual before collective 3 rights and the principle of parallel responsibilities 4 the legitimacy of rule comes from the principle of authorization and recognition by the ruled these principles can be summarized as the principle of rights modern society uses the principle of rights to construct the order of the world


this course will demonstrate these themes by discussing the following questions how did human thought establish the basic principles that formed the basis of order for ancient societies how to abandon and change these ancient principles how to establish the basic principles that brought mankind into modern society why do human beings have responsibilities and why have rights

the course innovation and entrepreneurship in the intelligent era has two era backgrounds one is the arrival of the intelligent era and the second is chinas innovation driven strategy i combine my professional background in information science and my experience in innovative education to combine intelligent technology with innovation and entrepreneurship in the course we will discuss how to carry out innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of the advent of the intelligent era and how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into various industries the goal of the course is to enable more people to benefit from technological innovation and innovation and entrepreneurship 


we summarize the course content into a model with two key points and three parts 


we propose an entrepreneurial capability model in the intelligent era this capability model has five levels in total the first level is the ability of self awareness including the clarification of self values the exploration of the meaning of life and the clarification of vision and goals this is the first ability the second ability is innovation ability specifically it is the combination of innovative mental models and innovative thinking methods the third ability is technical ability which means understanding computational thinking and the ability to use intelligent technology to design products the fourth ability refers to business ability including management ability market and channel ability capital and industry experience and the fifth ability is the ability to work in a team 


therefore our courses have two focuses the first focus is the cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities our courses specially set up innovative ability cultivation modules to improve innovation capabilities through practical training methods specifically it is to improve innovation capabilities through the training of innovative mental models and innovative ways of thinking 


for entrepreneurship we will take you to observe the whole process of entrepreneurship so as to tell you the truth about entrepreneurship at the same time it guides everyone to think about whether they are suitable for starting a business we can regard this part of the content as a general course on innovation and entrepreneurship which is suitable for all students to learn and this part of the content does not require any knowledge background in other disciplines 


the second focus is technological innovation in the intelligent era we will discuss how to use intelligent technology to carry our innovation and entrepreneurship practices and how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into the industry this part is mainly from the perspective of technological innovation for example we will talk about computational thinking we will talk about machine learning we will talk about data technology and internet technology and we will talk about how intelligent technology is implemented in various industries 


this focus will involve some mathematical knowledge and computer science knowledge considering that our course is a general course for all majors we will minimize the introduction of mathematics and professional knowledge and only give relevant technical background  we will try to explain it in an easy to understand way of course it will be helpful for you to understand the course if you have professional background knowledge 


three parts of the course in the first part we will discuss the opportunities and challenges we face in the era of artificial intelligence this part has a preliminary discussion on the application of artificial intelligence to industries in the second part we will discuss the entrepreneurial capability model and focus on cultivating innovation capabilities this part corresponds to our first focus the third part will discuss technological innovation in the intelligent era especially computational thinking and machine learning technology this part corresponds to our second focus 


considering that this course is a practical course we have designed a project guide link at the end of each part through this link we can first help you solve the problem of topic selection and guide you to find innovative ideas with practical value in addition we will comment on some representative projects that i have directed in the project guide link through the explanation of the project we will have an in depth understanding of the project understand the content of the course
in addition considering the practical nature of this course we will invite entrepreneurial mentors who have long been working on the front lines of entrepreneurship and investment to talk about innovation entrepreneurship and artificial intelligence in the last part of the project guide 

the focus of the course is to cultivate the following three abilities the first is to cultivate innovation ability it means cultivating innovative mental models and ways of thinking understanding innovation in the intelligent era and having the ability to transform innovative ideas into innovative projects the second is to cultivate technical capabilities through the understanding of intelligent technology including computational thinking and machine learning we have the ability to transform innovative projects into products the third is to develop team capabilities we emphasize teamwork skills which are also necessary skills for starting a business through our innovative project training everyone can train their team skills communication skills and organizational collaboration skills in a group "

even if you have struggled with math in the past it does not mean you will be at a disadvantage in this class we believe that the training of logical thinking is more important than calculation ability by the end of the course you will have a better sense of how to extract effective information from complicated data statistical analysis in other peoples research will no longer be a restricted area for you to read you will learn how to be a consumer of statistical principles and apply statistical thinking to apply it to your own research

the most important thing is to cultivate chinese engineers who are future oriented and world oriented 



chinas current one belt one road and made in china 2025 construction requires a large number of engineering talents with cross cultural and global perspectives it also requires engineers to have an awareness of engineering ethics in different cultures


in view of this engineering ethics education has received great attention from the engineering community education circles and relevant government departments it has become a consensus among all walks of life to comprehensively promote engineering ethics education in engineering education in 2015 the national engineering professional degree graduate education steering committee organized tsinghua university beijing institute of technology more than a dozen experts from universities peking union medical college dalian university of technology zhejiang university and other institutions collaborated to compile the engineering ethics textbook and record related mooc courses

if human history is roughly divided it can be divided into ancient society and modern society whether it is ancient society or modern society they are closely related to human thought real change in human society is guided by changes in thought and is shaped by the principles established by thought


what makes ancient society an ancient society is that it is based on five major principles established by ancient thought 1 the principle of teleology 2 the principle of goodness above all else 3 the principle of giving priority to responsibility and obedience 4 rule the principle that the legitimacy comes from a transcendent person outside of people fifth the principle that the collective takes precedence over the individual these principles are implemented and implemented by converting them into responsibility principles therefore ancient society first stipulated the relationship between people based on the principle of responsibility and used this to construct the order of the world


through the deep awareness and systematic demonstration of human individual freedom the enlightenment established a series of basic principles for modern society that are different from the principles of ancient society 1 the principle of freedom first 2 the principle of individual before collective 3 rights and the principle of parallel responsibilities 4 the legitimacy of rule comes from the principle of authorization and recognition by the ruled these principles can be summarized as the principle of rights modern society uses the principle of rights to construct the order of the world


this course will demonstrate these themes by discussing the following questions how did human thought establish the basic principles that formed the basis of order for ancient societies how to abandon and change these ancient principles how to establish the basic principles that brought mankind into modern society why do human beings have responsibilities and why have rights
